I initially tried using python audio tools and PySndFile but
I think this is the best cross platform solution. I'm going to
use this with the CreateSFX.py script in the UniSampler repo. 
I'd like to try and make a version of Pyliaison that builds
a DLL and import this as a module - should be interesting.
